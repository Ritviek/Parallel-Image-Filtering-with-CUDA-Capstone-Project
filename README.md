# Parallel-Image-Filtering-with-CUDA
A practical implementation of parallel computing techniques for image processing. This project leverages the CUDA architecture to execute image filters on the GPU, demonstrating a substantial reduction in processing time and highlighting the architectural advantages of GPUs for data-parallel tasks compared to CPU-based methods.
